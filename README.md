# NES Emulator

## Description

This is my implementation of the jsnes library [https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes](https://github.com/bfirsh/jsnes).

Huge appreciation to Ben Firshman and the entire team of contributors behind the jsnes library.

This NES Emulator project allows you to play classic NES games directly in your web browser.

## Features

- Play NES games right in the browser
- Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support

## Usage

Install all required packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the Emulator:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

## Mobile Usage

For the best experience on mobile devices, it is recommended to install the emulator as a Progressive Web App (PWA).

1. Open the emulator website on your mobile browser. Follow these steps:
2. Tap the “Add to Home Screen” prompt (available on most modern browsers like Chrome and Safari).
3. The emulator will be added to your home screen for quick access.
